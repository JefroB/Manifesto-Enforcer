# Chat Command System - Command Pattern Implementation

This directory contains the refactored chat intent parser using the **Command Pattern**. The previous large `if/else if` block in `generateManifestoCompliantResponse` has been replaced with a scalable and extensible command system.

## Architecture Overview

```
src/commands/
├── IChatCommand.ts          # Interface defining the command contract
├── ChatCommandManager.ts    # Central manager for routing messages to commands
├── LintCommand.ts          # Handles linting and code quality requests
├── EditCommand.ts          # Handles file editing and modification requests
├── GraphCommand.ts         # Handles code analysis and dependency graphs
├── GlossaryCommand.ts      # Handles glossary and definition management
├── ManifestoCommand.ts     # Handles manifesto display and generation
├── CodeCommand.ts          # Handles code generation requests
├── index.ts               # Clean exports for the command system
└── __tests__/             # Test suite for the command system
```

## Key Benefits

### 🔧 **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new commands without modifying existing code
- Each command is self-contained and focused on a single responsibility
- Commands can be added/removed dynamically at runtime

### 🎯 **Maintainability**
- No more large `if/else if` blocks to maintain
- Each command handles its own logic and patterns
- Clear separation of concerns

### 🧪 **Testability**
- Each command can be tested independently
- Mock state managers can be easily injected
- Command routing logic is isolated and testable

### 📈 **Scalability**
- Adding new chat features doesn't require touching existing commands
- Commands can have their own complex logic without affecting others
- Easy to optimize individual commands for performance

## Command Interface

All commands implement the `IChatCommand` interface:

```typescript
export interface IChatCommand {
    command: string;                                    // Primary trigger (e.g., "/lint")
    canHandle(input: string): boolean;                  // Pattern matching logic
    execute(input: string, stateManager: StateManager): Promise<string>; // Command execution
}
```

## Available Commands

### 🔍 **LintCommand** (`/lint`)
**Patterns:** `/lint`, `/fix`, "check code", "validate", "analyze errors"
- Analyzes code for manifesto compliance issues
- Provides specific fixes and suggestions
- Supports both file-specific and project-wide linting

### ✏️ **EditCommand** (`/edit`)
**Patterns:** `/edit`, "modify", "update", "change", "fix", "add to"
- Handles file editing and modification requests
- Provides context-aware editing suggestions
- Integrates with codebase indexing for smart edits

### 📊 **GraphCommand** (`/graph`)
**Patterns:** `/references`, `/impact`, `/graph`, "dependencies", "analyze structure"
- Code dependency analysis and impact assessment
- Reference finding and usage tracking
- Complexity hotspot identification

### 📖 **GlossaryCommand** (`/glossary`)
**Patterns:** `/glossary`, `/define`, `/lookup`, "what does X mean", "define X as Y"
- Project glossary management
- Term definitions and lookups
- Usage tracking and suggestions

### 📋 **ManifestoCommand** (`/manifesto`)
**Patterns:** `/manifesto`, "show rules", "generate manifesto", "manifesto compliance"
- Displays current manifesto rules
- Generates specialized manifestos (QA, Security, API, etc.)
- Manifesto compliance analysis

### 💻 **CodeCommand** (`/code`)
**Patterns:** "write", "create", "generate", "build", "make", "function", "class", "component"
- Code generation with manifesto compliance
- Template creation for various code patterns
- Context-aware code suggestions

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Command

1. **Create the command class:**
```typescript
// src/commands/MyNewCommand.ts
import { IChatCommand } from './IChatCommand';
import { StateManager } from '../core/StateManager';

export class MyNewCommand implements IChatCommand {
    public readonly command = '/mynew';

    canHandle(input: string): boolean {
        return /\/mynew|my new feature/i.test(input);
    }

    async execute(input: string, stateManager: StateManager): Promise<string> {
        return "My new command response!";
    }
}
```

2. **Register in ChatCommandManager:**
```typescript
// Add to ChatCommandManager.initializeCommands()
this.commands = [
    // ... existing commands
    new MyNewCommand()
];
```

3. **Export from index.ts:**
```typescript
export { MyNewCommand } from './MyNewCommand';
```

### Dynamic Command Management

```typescript
const commandManager = new ChatCommandManager();

// Add command at runtime
commandManager.addCommand(new MyCustomCommand());

// Remove command
commandManager.removeCommand('LintCommand');

// Test input matching
const result = commandManager.testInput('/lint my code');
console.log(result); // { matched: true, commandName: 'LintCommand', command: '/lint' }
```

## Migration from Old System

The old `generateManifestoCompliantResponse` function with its large `if/else if` block has been completely replaced:

**Before:**
```typescript
async function generateManifestoCompliantResponse(userInput: string): Promise<string> {
    if (isSlashEditRequest) {
        return await handleEditCommand(userInput);
    } else if (isSlashManifestoRequest) {
        return await handleManifestoCommand(userInput);
    } else if (isSlashGlossaryRequest || isDefineRequest || isLookupRequest) {
        return await handleGlossaryCommand(userInput);
    } // ... many more conditions
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
private async handleUserMessage(message: string): Promise<void> {
    const response = await this.commandManager.handleMessage(message, this.stateManager);
    this.sendResponse(response);
}
```

## Testing

Run the command system tests:
```bash
npm test -- src/commands/__tests__/
```

The test suite covers:
- Command routing and pattern matching
- Natural language processing
- Command execution
- Dynamic command management
- Error handling

## Performance Considerations

- Commands are instantiated once at startup
- Pattern matching is optimized with early returns
- Each command handles its own caching and optimization
- State manager is passed by reference to avoid copying

## Future Enhancements

- **Command Aliases:** Allow multiple triggers per command
- **Command Chaining:** Support for complex multi-step operations
- **Command History:** Track and replay previous commands
- **Command Permissions:** Role-based command access
- **Command Analytics:** Usage tracking and optimization insights

**Mission 3 Complete: Chat System Refactored to Command Pattern** ✅

The chat intent parser has been successfully refactored from a monolithic `if/else if` block into a clean, extensible Command Pattern implementation that supports easy maintenance, testing, and future enhancements.
