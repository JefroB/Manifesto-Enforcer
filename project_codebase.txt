		/**
		 * Tokens in a file are represented as an array of integers. The position of each token is expressed relative to
		 * the token before it, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
		 *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
		 *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
		 *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
		 *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
		 *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How to encode tokens
		 *
		 * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
		 * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
		 * ```
		 *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
		 *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
		 * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
		 * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
		 * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
		 * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
		 * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
		 * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
		 * ```
		 *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @see {@link SemanticTokensBuilder} for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
		 * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until the editor decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
		 */
		provideDocumentSemanticTokens(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>;

		/**
		 * Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement
		 * this method (`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How tokens change when the document changes
		 *
		 * Suppose that `provideDocumentSemanticTokens` has previously returned the following semantic tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Also suppose that after some edits, the new semantic tokens in a file are:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 * It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // old tokens
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // new tokens
		 *
		 *    edit: { start:  0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] } // replace integer at offset 0 with 3
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot compute `SemanticTokensEdits`, it can "give up" and return all the tokens in the document again.
		 * *NOTE*: All edits in `SemanticTokensEdits` contain indices in the old integers array, so they all refer to the previous result state.

		 *
		 * *Note* that uris passed through `openExternal` are automatically resolved and you should not call `asExternalUri` on them.
		 *
		 * #### `vscode.env.uriScheme`
		 *
		 * Creates a uri that - if opened in a browser (e.g. via `openExternal`) - will result in a registered {@link UriHandler}
		 * to trigger.

		 * *Note* that if the server decides to add additional query parameters to the uri (e.g. a token or secret), it
		 * will appear in the uri that is passed to the {@link UriHandler}.
		 *
		 * **Example** of an authentication flow:
		 * ```typescript
		 * vscode.window.registerUriHandler({

		 *     if (uri.path === '/did-authenticate') {

		 *
		 * const callableUri = await vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(vscode.env.uriScheme + '://my.extension/did-authenticate'));
		 * await vscode.env.openExternal(callableUri);
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *Note* that extensions should not cache the result of `asExternalUri` as the resolved uri may become invalid due to
		 * a system or user action — for example, in remote cases, a user may close a port forwarding tunnel that was opened by
		 * `asExternalUri`.
		 *
		 * #### Any other scheme
		 *
		 * Any other scheme will be handled as if the provided URI is a workspace URI. In that case, the method will return

		/**
		 * Creates a file system watcher that is notified on file events (create, change, delete)
		 * depending on the parameters provided.
		 *
		 * By default, all opened {@link workspace.workspaceFolders workspace folders} will be watched
		 * for file changes recursively.
		 *
		 * Additional paths can be added for file watching by providing a {@link RelativePattern} with
		 * a `base` path to watch. If the path is a folder and the `pattern` is complex (e.g. contains
		 * `**` or path segments), it will be watched recursively and otherwise will be watched
		 * non-recursively (i.e. only changes to the first level of the path will be reported).
		 *
		 * *Note* that paths that do not exist in the file system will be monitored with a delay until
		 * created and then watched depending on the parameters provided. If a watched path is deleted,
		 * the watcher will suspend and not report any events until the path is created again.
		 *
		 * If possible, keep the use of recursive watchers to a minimum because recursive file watching
		 * is quite resource intense.
		 *
		 * Providing a `string` as `globPattern` acts as convenience method for watching file events in
		 * all opened workspace folders. It cannot be used to add more folders for file watching, nor will
		 * it report any file events from folders that are not part of the opened workspace folders.
		 *
		 * Optionally, flags to ignore certain kinds of events can be provided.
		 *
		 * To stop listening to events the watcher must be disposed.
		 *
		 * *Note* that file events from recursive file watchers may be excluded based on user configuration.
		 * The setting `files.watcherExclude` helps to reduce the overhead of file events from folders
		 * that are known to produce many file changes at once (such as `.git` folders). As such,
		 * it is highly recommended to watch with simple patterns that do not require recursive watchers
		 * where the exclude settings are ignored and you have full control over the events.
		 *
		 * *Note* that symbolic links are not automatically followed for file watching unless the path to
		 * watch itself is a symbolic link.
		 *
		 * *Note* that the file paths that are reported for having changed may have a different path casing
		 * compared to the actual casing on disk on case-insensitive platforms (typically macOS and Windows
		 * but not Linux). We allow a user to open a workspace folder with any desired path casing and try
		 * to preserve that. This means:
		 * * if the path is within any of the workspace folders, the path will match the casing of the
		 *   workspace folder up to that portion of the path and match the casing on disk for children
		 * * if the path is outside of any of the workspace folders, the casing will match the case of the
		 *   path that was provided for watching
		 * In the same way, symbolic links are preserved, i.e. the file event will report the path of the
		 * symbolic link as it was provided for watching and not the target.
		 *
		 * ### Examples
		 *
		 * The basic anatomy of a file watcher is as follows:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * const watcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(<folder>, <pattern>));
		 *
		 * watcher.onDidChange(uri => { ... }); // listen to files being changed
		 * watcher.onDidCreate(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders being created
		 * watcher.onDidDelete(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders getting deleted
		 *
		 * watcher.dispose(); // dispose after usage
		 * ```
		 *
		 * #### Workspace file watching
		 *
		 * If you only care about file events in a specific workspace folder:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0], '**​/*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * If you want to monitor file events across all opened workspace folders:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**​/*.js');
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *Note:* the array of workspace folders can be empty if no workspace is opened (empty window).
		 *
		 * #### Out of workspace file watching
		 *
		 * To watch a folder for changes to *.js files outside the workspace (non recursively), pass in a `Uri` to such
		 * a folder:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * And use a complex glob pattern to watch recursively:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '**​/*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Here is an example for watching the active editor for file changes:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri, '*'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @param globPattern A {@link GlobPattern glob pattern} that controls which file events the watcher should report.
		 * @param ignoreCreateEvents Ignore when files have been created.
		 * @param ignoreChangeEvents Ignore when files have been changed.
		 * @param ignoreDeleteEvents Ignore when files have been deleted.
		 * @returns A new file system watcher instance. Must be disposed when no longer needed.

	 * Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
	 * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	 * programming languages.
	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	 * that can be called with a {@link TextDocument} and a {@link Position} returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	 * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	 * 	provideHover(document, position, token) {
	 * 		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Registration is done using a {@link DocumentSelector document selector} which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	 * a more complex {@link DocumentFilter filter} like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	 * a selector will result in a {@link languages.match score} that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like {@link languages.registerHoverProvider hover},
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like {@link languages.registerCompletionItemProvider IntelliSense} the
	 * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

**Core Principles:**
• **Comprehensive Error Handling**: All functions must include try-catch blocks
• **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs before processing
• **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for all public functions
• **Security First**: Never trust user input, sanitize everything
• **Testing**: Write tests for all critical functionality

**Quick Actions:**
• Use \`/manifesto create\` to generate project-specific rules
• Use \`/lint\` to check code compliance
• Use \`/fix\` to auto-fix common issues

*LocalAgent provides basic guidance. For advanced AI assistance, connect to Auggie or other AI agents.*`;

**Required Pattern:**
\`\`\`typescript
try {
    // Your code here
    if (!input) {
        throw new Error('Invalid input');
    }
    // Process input
} catch (error) {
    const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error';
    console.error('Operation failed:', errorMessage);
    // Handle gracefully
}
\`\`\`

**Key Rules:**
• Always use try-catch for async operations
• Validate inputs before processing
• Provide meaningful error messages
• Log errors for debugging
• Never let errors crash the application`;
    }

    /**
     * Get security guidance
     */

**Input Validation:**
• Check for null/undefined values
• Validate data types
• Sanitize user input
• Use allowlists, not blocklists

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
• Avoid \`innerHTML\` - use \`textContent\`
• Escape user data in HTML
• Validate file paths
• Use parameterized queries

**Example:**
\`\`\`typescript
if (!input || typeof input !== 'string' || input.length > 1000) {
    throw new Error('Invalid input');
}
\`\`\``;
    }

    /**
     * Get testing guidance
     */
    private getTestingGuidance(): string {
        return `🧪 **Testing Best Practices**

**Test Structure:**
• Unit tests for individual functions
• Integration tests for workflows
• Error case testing
• Edge case validation

**Required Coverage:**
• All public methods
• Error handling paths
• Input validation
• Critical business logic

**Example:**
\`\`\`typescript
it('should handle invalid input gracefully', () => {
    expect(() => myFunction(null)).toThrow('Invalid input');
